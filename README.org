#+title: Ancillary Service Monitor
* ancillary

Ancillary is a monitor for your service that runs on tha Java JVM runtime for
monitoring Java based applications and for running commandline programs for
testing a service's status on the local machine for the purpose of determining
if the cluster is healthy and/or if the local instance is healthy and servicing
requests.

Ancillary uses a dynamic class loader to load plugins that are compiled
separately in their own jars.

Ancillary was inspired by an internal program we wrote in Python that would
check cluster health during a deploy to ensure there was no downtime while
taking down cluster members to replace them. There were a few instances where
Python proved to be lacking when these clusters spoke Java, and Python did not.
